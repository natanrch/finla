FINLA

This is a system for controling earnings and expenses I have as a Freelancer worker. I made it with Laravel for studies purpose, but the real thing is to make a mobile version of it.

The main idea is establishing limits to what the user can expend per month. As freelancers don't have money all the time, we have to live with a maximum expense per month.
